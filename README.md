GenesisHub's Main custom Plugins.

##Version
gFeatures Core/API: 2.4.9

## Info
gFeatures is a plugin for Bukkit/Spigot, Sponge, and CanaryMod. Our goal is to provide a modular system to power the backend of servers.
gFeatures allows easier than before manageability, with a JavaFX GUI (WIP).
The gFeatures Universal Binary allows gFeatures to run on Bukkit-Compatible, Sponge, and Canary servers.

## Notes
All the packages under "tk.genesishub.*" was part of gFeatures 1.0, and is Obsolete.

gFeatures2 is under "net.genesishub.*" & "net.dolphinbox.*" and is currently in active development.
