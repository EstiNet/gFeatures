INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE


	Well, there is not much to it. Itâ€™s a very easy theme to setup. But for the sake of clarity, here are some of the points you should keep in mind applying this theme to your project-

	1. The  minimum size of the header image should be at least 1440*900. Otherwise, the image may look stretched or blurred.

	2. The recommended size for the featured images in posts is 400*400. 

	3. The posts do not currently have a full width feature. It will be added in future updates to the theme.
